# Dungeon 3D
The source code to the browser game Dungeon 3D developed in Cocos Creator.

# About the project
This is the Alpha version of Dungeon 3D, A 3D browser based FPS game built in Cocos Creator 3.6.1. 

# Usage
This game source code and its assets are free for you to edit, fork, learn and build on top of for commercial or personal projects. Although please do not re release an exact copy. The sounds were either created by me or sourced from https://freesound.org. Textures were either made by me or are from https://3dtextures.me. Everything else was made by me with the help of the developers and community for Cocos Creator.

# Early release
This is an early release and wasn't intially created for a release. It's also my first project in Cocos Creator so keep that in mind too. Some parts of the code will be rushed and messy and commented out code but I think there is a lot in the game that should help developers learn Cocos Creator. Just keep in mind there will be bugs and nothing is perfect.

# Support this project
